This web-based app written in Python will first scan your current emotion with the help of OpenCV & then crop the image of your face from the entire frame once the cropped image is ready it will give this image to a trained MACHINE LEARNING model to predict the emotion of the cropped image. This will happen 30-40 times in 2-3 seconds, now once we have a list of emotions (containing duplicate elements) with us it will first sort the list based on frequency & remove the duplicates. After performing all the above steps we will have a list containing the user's emotions in sorted order, Now we have to iterate over the list & recommend songs based on emotions in the list.
